    <h3>Operation Rah-e-Nijat</h3>
    <p>Operation Rah-e-Nijat was launched in June 2009, with the main offensive starting on October 17, 2009, in South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan. Its objective was to eliminate Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and their allies, restore government control, and dismantle terrorist infrastructure.It was a large-scale joint military operation by the Pakistan Armed Forces against the TTP and foreign militants, including Uzbeks and Arabs, in South Waziristan. The operation aimed to root out terrorism from one of the most dangerous militant strongholds. Ground troops from XI Corps, special forces, and air support were deployed from three fronts: Razmak (north), Jandola (east), and Shakai (west). The Pakistan Air Force conducted heavy aerial bombing to clear militant hideouts. Naval surveillance and intelligence also supported the operation. More than 594 militants were killed, while 80 Pakistani soldiers embraced martyrdom. Despite military success, top TTP leaders escaped to Afghanistan.By December 12, 2009, South Waziristan was brought under government control. The operation caused the displacement of over 120,000 civilians. It was followed by further operations in Orakzai and other tribal areas.Operation Rah-e-Nijat marked a turning point in Pakistan's war on terror. It successfully dismantled key TTP strongholds and showcased a coordinated effort involving the Army, Air Force, Navy, and intelligence agencies. However, the escape of militant leadership highlighted the challenges of cross-border militancy.

    <h3>Operation Buyaan-ul-Marsoos</h3>
    <p>Operation Buyaan-ul-Marsoos, launched by Pakistan on May 10, 2025, was a major military response to India's Operation Sindoor, which targeted multiple sites in Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir. The operation aimed to defend Pakistan’s sovereignty, targeting over 20 Indian military installations, including airbases like Udhampur, Pathankot, and missile depots in Beas and Nagrota.The operation’s name means "a wall of solid lead", drawn from the Quran, symbolizing strength and unity. In addition to missile strikes, cyberattacks were launched on India's infrastructure, disrupting 70% of the northern power grid and affecting government systems.This has led to escalated regional tensions, with the international community calling for de-escalation, as both countries are nuclear powers. Pakistan defended the operation as lawful retaliation, while India remains alert and prepared for further developments.
